This project outcome belongs to **Daniel Mendoza** and **GÃ¼lce Padem** who are currently junior Data Scientists/AI Operators in making at BeCode's Theano 2.27 promotion.

**Repository:** motor_graders

**Type of Challenge:** Learning

**Duration:** 2 weeks

**Deadline:** 02/04/2021 09:00 AM

**Deployment strategy:** Github page

**Team challenge:** Group project

## Mission objectives

- Be able to work and process data from audio format
- Find insights from data, build hypothesis and define conclusions
- Build machine learning models for predictive classification and/or regression
- Select the right performance metrics for your model
- Evaluate the distribution of datapoints and evaluate its influence in the model
- Be able to identify underfitting or overfitting that might exist on the model
- Tuning parameters of the model for better performance
- Select the model with better performance and following your
  customer's requirements
- Define the strengths and limitations of the model

## The Mission

Acme Corporation is a worldwide supplier of technological equipment. The factory is facing significant problems with their manufacturing line, the machines are constantly facing failures due to a lack of maintenance and the production is stopped every time an unexpected failure is presented. As a result, Acme is losing millions of U.S Dollars and important clients like Wile E. Coyote are experiencing delays in deliveries.

The company has collected audio samples of equipment working on normal and anomalous conditions. Their objective is to develop a machine learning model able to monitor the operations and identify anomalies in the sound pattern.

The implementation of this model can allow Acme to operate the manufacturing equipment at full capacity and detect signs of failure before the damage is so critical that the production line has to be stopped.

Our mission is to build a machine learning model for Acme so they can continue their manufacturing activities and help the Coyote to catch the roadrunner.

### Installation

For requested packages, conda package manager was used. Extra needed packages are the following (see the parantheses for the command to install with conda):

* pandas (conda install -c conda-forge pandas)
* librosa (conda install -c conda-forge librosa)
* imblearn (conda install -c conda-forge imblearn)

Jupyter Notebook was installed and launched from the Conda navigator activated in the working environment.

### Repository

There is only a **master** branche under the repository.

#### Master Branch

The structure:

* README.md
* 0.Files_info
* 1.Features_and_targets
* 2.Models
* Exploration_phase
* k_fold
* random_forest
* .gitignore


`README.md`
You are reading it now. It is important to read the whole file before forking or cloning.


`.gitignore`
This file is to ignore the notebook checkpoints

#### Development Branch

Can be discarded for now. Will be back in use for the further developments of the project and the README file will be updated accordingly.
